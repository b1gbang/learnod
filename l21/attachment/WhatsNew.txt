  Version 0.6
  -----------
  A messagebox displays the name of the patched OllyDBG.  Thanks to Shub-nigurrath.
  Deletes the Exports Directory of the new Olly.  (Used by ExeCrypt).  Again to Shub-nigurrath.
  New GUI.  Thanks to bLaCk-eye.
  Now changes the name of ollydbg.exe to a random name.

  Version 0.51
  -----------
  Fixed a bug that changed the name of ollydbg.ini messing up some plugins.
  Now fixes window class name.  This only works for the 'On disk' option.
  Now reloads the file after patching on disk.
  Fixed a bug that occured if the app was closed before hitting 'OK' in RE-Pair.
  Fixed some other UI related bugs.  I know there are more, but im lazy.

  Version 0.4
  -----------
  Added option to fix any tools caption in memory.  This is good for packed apps
  and one time changes in the .exes caption.  Please let me know if you find a tool
  that either option (in mem/on disk) doesnt work for.	

  Version 0.3
  -----------
  Added option to fix any tools caption on disk.

  Version 0.2
  -----------
  Lost my sources so i had to recode most of the program
  Currently it changes classname/captions of: OllyDbg, Smartcheck and Reg/Filemon.
  I have also added a patch that fixes the OutputDebugString Vurn.  All credit for this patch
  goes to goggles99, Flagmax, JuneMouse, gabri3l, and others from Woodman and Exetools.  
  Mostly googles99, because i used his sources.  I just added to my tool to make it an 'all-in-one'
  solution.  I no longer plan to add any SI support as IceExt does an excellent job of this.
  
  Version 0.1
  -----------
  First release.  Right now all that it does is:
  'Fixes' RegMon, FileMon, and SmartCheck by giving them random Class names.
  *Note*  This does not work on the ia64XP version of FileMon or RegMon. 
  *Note*  The filemon/regmon patch was tested on version 5.x.  The class
	  names changed a bit in previous versions.  So if you get the 
	  'wrong file' error, just upgrade to the newest version of regmon 
	  or filemon.  No versions before 5.0 will be supported, but newer
  	  versions will.

  Hooks the API IsDebuggerPresent to always return FALSE.  This will help 
  protect Olly and SmartCheck against calls to this API.
  *Note*  This does not help against anti-SI code.
  *Note*  This currently only works on 9x.
  *Note*  This only works when the program is running.

  Still to come:
  A decent GUI.  (Maybe.)
  IsDebuggerPresent hook for NT based systems.
  Renaming of SmartChecks .SUP files.
